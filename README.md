-At first, equals medthod is not written in fundamental java method so it cannot be checked condition completely. 
This is because there is no Object to compare whether it is similar or not. Then it returns false instead of true.


-Because The equals(Person other) method only checks for the name of the Person so this returned true while 
It should be false because a and b are different class.
